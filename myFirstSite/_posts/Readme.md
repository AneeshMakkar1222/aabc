# Hosting the resume in Markdown on GitHub

## *Purpose*
---
Learning the practical steps of hosting and formatting a resume using Markdown, Markdown editor, Github Pages and Jekyll. Another purpose relate these practical steps described above to the general principles of current Technical
Writing, as explained in Andrew Etter's book Modern Technical Writing
## *Prerequisites*
---
The first requirement is the knowlege of markdown language which is needed to write a resume in markdown format. Then there is also a need of editor which supports markdown format. For more information on Markdown I have attached a link to a Markdown tutorial under "More Resources" section.

## *Instructions*
---
### 1. **Use Lightweight Markup**
### 2. **Uploading Documents on Distributed Version Control System**
> The version-control system which will be used in this 
> assignment is Github. There are some reasons due to which 
> version controlled systems are preffered by a lot of
> people. Firstly, distributed version control system(DVCS)
> have better performance. Secondly, DVCS can be used for
> offline work and are considered superior for concurrent 
> work on the same file. Lastly, the most prominent reason 
> for the technical writers to use DVCS is that developers 
> prefer them.

### 3. **Host a Staic Website**
#### *Advantages of Static Websites*
>  According to Etter, static websites are advantageous as:-

> databases, and nothing to install, so migrating the entire
